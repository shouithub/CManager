Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the program is not restricted, and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the program). Whether that is true depends on what the program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must make the license of the entire whole available to all parties who would otherwise be covered by this License.

Thus, it is not the intention of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the intention of this provision to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the donor not to undermine the consistency of that system.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

GNU 通用公共许可证

第2版，1991年6月

版权所有 (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

允许每个人复制和分发本许可证的逐字副本，但不允许修改。

序言

大多数软件的许可证旨在剥夺您分享和修改软件的自由。与此相反，GNU 通用公共许可证旨在保证您分享和修改自由软件的自由——确保软件对所有用户都是自由的。本通用公共许可证适用于自由软件基金会的大多数软件，以及任何其他承诺使用它的程序的作者。（自由软件基金会的某些其他软件受 GNU 库通用公共许可证覆盖。）您也可以将其应用于您的程序。

当我们谈论自由软件时，我们指的是自由，而不是价格。我们的通用公共许可证旨在确保您有分发自由软件副本的自由（如果您愿意，可以为此服务收费），您可以收到源代码或如果您想要它，您可以更改软件或在新自由程序中使用它的部分；并且您知道您可以做这些事情。

为了保护您的权利，我们需要做出限制，禁止任何人否认您的这些权利或要求您放弃这些权利。这些限制转化为您在分发软件副本或修改它时的某些责任。

例如，如果您分发此类程序的副本，无论是否收费，您必须给予接收者您拥有的所有权利。您必须确保他们也收到或可以获得源代码。您必须向他们展示这些条款，以便他们知道自己的权利。

我们通过两个步骤保护您的权利：（1）对软件进行版权保护，以及（2）向您提供此许可证，该许可证赋予您复制、分发和/或修改软件的法律许可。

此外，为了每个作者的保护和我们的保护，我们希望确保每个人都明白，对于这个自由软件没有保证。如果软件被其他人修改并传递，我们希望其接收者知道他们拥有的是不是原版，以便其他人引入的问题不会反映在原作者的声誉上。

最后，任何自由程序都不断受到软件专利的威胁。我们希望避免再分发自由程序的人单独获得专利许可证，从而有效地使程序专有的危险。为了防止这种情况，我们明确表示任何专利必须为每个人的自由使用许可或根本不许可。

复制、分发和修改的确切条款和条件如下。

GNU 通用公共许可证

复制、分发和修改的条款和条件

0. 本许可证适用于任何程序或其他作品，其中包含版权持有人放置的通知，说明它可以在本通用公共许可证的条款下分发。下面的“程序”是指任何此类程序或作品，“基于程序的作品”是指程序或根据版权法对其的任何衍生作品：也就是说，包含程序或其部分的作品，无论是否逐字或经过修改和/或翻译成另一种语言。（此处，翻译包括在“修改”一词中，没有限制。）每个被许可人被称为“你”。

除了复制、分发和修改之外的其他活动不受本许可证覆盖；它们超出了其范围。运行程序的行为不受限制，程序的输出仅在内容构成基于程序的作品时才受覆盖（独立于通过运行程序制作）。这是否属实取决于程序做什么。

1. 您可以按照您收到的方式复制和分发程序源代码的逐字副本，在任何介质上，前提是您在每个副本上明显且适当地发布适当的版权通知和保证免责声明；保持所有引用本许可证和任何保证缺席的通知完整；并为程序的其他接收者提供本许可证的副本以及程序。

您可以为转移副本的物理行为收费，您可以选择提供保修保护以换取费用。

2. 您可以修改您的程序副本或其任何部分，从而形成基于程序的作品，并根据上述第1节的条款复制和分发此类修改或作品，前提是您还满足所有这些条件：

a) 您必须使修改的文件携带突出通知，说明您更改了文件以及任何更改的日期。

b) 您必须使您分发或发布的任何作品（全部或部分包含或衍生自程序或其任何部分）作为一个整体，在本许可证的条款下免费许可给所有第三方。

c) 如果修改的程序在运行时通常以交互方式读取命令，您必须使其在以最普通的方式启动运行此类交互使用时，打印或显示公告，包括适当的版权通知和没有保证的通知（或者说您提供保证），以及用户可以在这些条件下再分发程序，并告诉用户如何查看本许可证的副本。（例外：如果程序本身是交互式的但通常不打印此类公告，则基于程序的作品不需要打印公告。）

这些要求适用于修改的作品作为一个整体。如果该作品的可识别部分不是从程序衍生出来的，并且可以合理地被视为独立和单独的作品本身，则本许可证及其条款在您将它们作为单独作品分发时不适用于这些部分。但是，当您将相同的部分作为基于程序的作品的整体的一部分分发时，整个整体的分发必须使整个整体的许可证对否则受本许可证覆盖的所有各方可用。

因此，本节的意图不是主张权利或争夺您完全由您撰写的作品的权利；相反，其意图是行使控制基于程序的衍生或集体作品分发的权利。

此外，仅将另一个不基于程序的作品与程序（或基于程序的作品）聚合在存储或分发介质的卷上，不会将另一个作品纳入本许可证的范围。

3. 您可以根据上述第1和第2节的条款，以对象代码或可执行形式复制和分发程序（或基于它的作品），前提是您还执行以下之一：

a) 用完整的相应机器可读源代码伴随它，该源代码必须根据上述第1和第2节的条款在通常用于软件交换的介质上分发；或者，

b) 用书面报价伴随它，有效期至少三年，向任何第三方提供不超过您物理执行源分发的成本的费用，完整的机器可读相应源代码副本，根据上述第1和第2节的条款在通常用于软件交换的介质上分发；或者，

c) 用您收到的关于分发相应源代码的报价的信息伴随它。（此替代方案仅允许非商业分发，并且仅当您以对象代码或可执行形式收到程序并附带此类报价时，根据上述子节b。）

作品的源代码意味着制作修改的首选形式。对于可执行作品，完整源代码意味着它包含的所有模块的所有源代码，加上任何关联的接口定义文件，加上用于控制可执行文件的编译和安装的脚本。然而，作为特殊例外，分发的源代码不需要包括通常与可执行文件运行的操作系统的主要组件（编译器、内核等）一起分发的任何东西（无论是源还是二进制形式），除非该组件本身伴随可执行文件。

如果通过提供从指定地点复制的访问来分发可执行文件或对象代码，则从同一地点提供复制源代码的等效访问算作源代码的分发，即使第三方不被迫与对象代码一起复制源。

4. 您不得复制、修改、再许可或分发程序，除非本许可证明确规定。任何其他复制、修改、再许可或分发程序的尝试都是无效的，并将自动终止您在本许可证下的权利。然而，从您在本许可证下收到副本或权利的各方，只要此类各方保持完全遵守，就不会终止其许可证。

5. 您不需要接受本许可证，因为您没有签署它。然而，没有其他东西授予您修改或分发程序或其衍生作品的许可。如果您不接受本许可证，这些行为是被法律禁止的。因此，通过修改或分发程序（或任何基于程序的作品），您表示接受本许可证这样做，以及复制、分发或修改程序或基于它的作品的所有条款和条件。

6. 每次您再分发程序（或任何基于程序的作品）时，接收者自动从原始许可人那里获得许可，根据这些条款和条件复制、分发或修改程序。您不得对接收者行使此处授予的权利施加任何进一步的限制。您不对第三方对本许可证的遵守负责。

7. 如果由于法院判决或专利侵权指控或其他原因（不限于专利问题），条件强加于您（无论通过法院命令、协议或其他方式）与本许可证的条件矛盾，它们不会免除您在本许可证下的义务。如果您不能同时满足您在本许可证下的义务和任何其他相关义务，那么结果是您根本不能分发程序。例如，如果专利许可证不允许所有通过您直接或间接收到副本的人免版税再分发程序，那么您满足两者并遵守本许可证的唯一方法是完全避免分发程序。

如果本节的任何部分在任何特定情况下被视为无效或不可执行，则本节的其余部分旨在适用，本节作为一个整体旨在在其他情况下适用。

本条款的意图不是诱使您侵犯任何专利或其他财产权利主张或质疑任何此类主张的有效性；本节的唯一目的是保护自由软件分发系统的完整性，该系统通过公共许可证实践实施。许多人通过该系统分发了广泛的软件，依靠该系统的一致应用；由捐赠者决定不破坏该系统的连贯性。

本节旨在彻底澄清什么是其余许可证的后果。

8. 如果程序的分发和/或使用在某些国家受到专利或版权接口的限制，则将程序置于本许可证下的原始版权持有人可以添加明确的地理分发限制，排除这些国家，以便分发仅在或在未排除的国家之间允许。在这种情况下，本许可证将限制纳入其中，就像写在本许可证的正文中一样。

9. 自由软件基金会可能会不时发布通用公共许可证的修订和/或新版本。此类新版本将在精神上类似于当前版本，但可能在细节上有所不同，以解决新问题或关注点。

每个版本都有一个独特的版本号。如果程序指定本许可证的版本号适用于它以及“任何更高版本”，您可以选择遵循该版本或自由软件基金会发布的任何更高版本的条款和条件。如果程序未指定本许可证的版本号，您可以选择自由软件基金会曾经发布的任何版本。

10. 如果您希望将程序的部分纳入其他分发条件不同的自由程序，请写信给作者请求许可。对于由自由软件基金会版权的软件，请写信给自由软件基金会；我们有时为此做出例外。我们的决定将由两个目标指导：保留我们自由软件的所有衍生物的自由状态，并促进软件的分享和重用。

无保证

11. 因为程序是免费许可的，在适用法律允许的范围内，没有程序的保证。除非另有书面声明，版权持有人和/或其他人按“原样”提供程序，没有任何形式的保证，无论是明示还是暗示，包括但不限于适销性和适合特定用途的暗示保证。程序的质量和性能的全部风险由您承担。如果程序证明有缺陷，您承担所有必要服务、修理或纠正的成本。

12. 除非适用法律要求或书面同意，否则任何版权持有人，或任何其他可能根据上述许可修改和/或再分发程序的方，对您不承担损害赔偿责任，包括任何一般、特殊、偶然或后果损害，由使用或无法使用程序引起（包括但不限于数据丢失或数据被渲染不准确或您或第三方遭受的损失，或程序无法与其他程序一起运行），即使此类持有人或其他方已被告知此类损害的可能性。

条款和条件的结束

如何将这些条款应用于您的新程序

如果您开发了一个新程序，并且您希望它对公众尽可能有用，最好的方法是使其成为自由软件，每个人都可以根据这些条款再分发和修改。

为此，将以下通知附加到程序上。将它们附加到每个源文件的开头是最安全的，以最有效地传达保证的排除；每个文件至少应该有“版权”行和指向完整通知所在位置的指针。

<一行给出程序的名称和它做什么的简要想法。>

版权所有 (C) 2025 上海海洋大学社团管理服务中心

本程序是自由软件；您可以在自由软件基金会发布的GNU通用公共许可证的条款下重新分发和/或修改它；许可证的第2版，或（根据您的选择）任何更高版本。

本程序分发希望它有用，但没有任何保证；甚至没有适销性或适合特定用途的暗示保证。有关更多详细信息，请参见GNU通用公共许可证。

您应该已经随本程序收到了GNU通用公共许可证的副本；如果没有，请写信给自由软件基金会，Inc.，51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA。
